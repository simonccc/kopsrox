# :question: FAQ

:question:  __can I migrate the kopsrox vms to other hosts in my proxmox cluster?__

It is mostly supported but a bit untested at the moment

:question:  __can I use debian as a base image vs ubuntu?__

I had to switch from debian due to some problem with a discovered interface which was dhcp and caused some network problems. ymmv.

:question:  __k3s_mon 30 second timeouts?__

Check network settings - the vms can't connect to the internet

:question:  __ListObjectsV2 search parameter metadata not implemented? for etcd snapshots__

got this running v1.26.10+k3s2 with cloudflare - upgrading to v1.27.8+k3s2 resolved this for me

:question: __how to re-add master-m1?__

uninstall k3s then run the node command to re add as a slave - if the m1 node was the vip master you will need to manually logon and remove the VIP ip from eth0
